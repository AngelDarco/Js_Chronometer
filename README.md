#### Hi, I'm Forrest, Forrest Gump. My mom told me to write to you to ask you to make me a stopwatch to know how much I run. I've told him that I don't need to know because I don't care, but she insisted so I'm telling you.
#### I want the stopwatch to have a button to start it, another to pause it, another to stop it, and another to reset it. Like all stopwatches. And that when I start it and pause it, it shows me a line on the page to know when I have paused it and when I have restarted it. If I stop and restart, the registration of the page should be deleted. Nothing more. Thank you.
